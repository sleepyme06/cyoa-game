    <div><h1>CHAPTER 8</h1></div>

    <div>
        <p>
            You and Rinki stand beneath the mango tree again.<br>
            The morning rain has stopped. The earth is soft, freshly turned.<br>
            Bhoot Raja floats above the grass, shimmering faintly in the daylight. He’s humming now — not poetry, just an old song. Peaceful. Unfinished.<br>
            The teakwood box sits at your feet. Inside it: the gold. The scroll. The will. The bangle.<br>
            And your phone buzzes.<br>
            Society Head:<br>
            "We are returning with the sadhu. And reinforcements. We WILL cleanse that vault."<br>
            You have no time.<br>
            YOU CHOOSE:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#part-goodendings">Mukti aur Makhanwala</a></li>
                <li><a href="#part-bad/wildendings">BhootTube Empire</a></li>
                <li><a href="#part-mischiefendings">Ghosts & Gulabjamuns</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="part-goodendings">
        <p>
            You turn to Bhoot Raja.<br>
            “You don’t need to stay here anymore. This isn’t just your story. It belongs to all of them. And it should be shared.”<br>
            Rinki records you reading the will aloud beneath the mango tree. She posts it online with the caption:<br>
            “Not all ghosts are scary. Some just really, really loved pulao.”<br>
            It goes viral within hours.<br>
            You donate the gold and the family recipes to a local archive.<br>
            The bungalow is restored into a museum and cultural library.<br>
            Kids on school trips giggle at the haunted bathroom.<br>
            Ghost-hunting interns take notes on the talking mango pit.<br>
            The guest bathroom is officially renamed The Emotional Cry Zone.<br>
            Bhoot Raja smiles. Faint. Glorious.<br>
            “Thank you,” he whispers. “Tell them I forgive Chhotu. And myself.”<br>
            And with that, he vanishes.<br>
            A breeze passes through the mango tree.<br>
            From then on, it blooms every year. Even in winter.<br>
            And the pulao?<br>
            It wins a National Culinary Award.<br>
            Of course it does.<br>
        </p>

    <div id="part-bad/wildendings">
        <p>
            You smirk.<br>
            “You know what this house needs?”<br>
            Rinki leans in.<br>
            “What?”<br>
            “Merchandise.”<br>
            Within two weeks, you and Rinki launch BhootTube — India’s first ghost-themed content empire.<br>
            The bungalow becomes:<br>
            A paranormal co-working space<br>
            A haunted pop-up kitchen featuring Raja’s Royal Pulao<br>
            A filming location for supernatural mukbangs<br>
            You release Bhoot Raja as a virtual influencer. His voice is used in dance remixes. His sherwani becomes a fashion trend. GuruMoo is hired as your brand mascot.<br>
            The EMF Walkman sells out.<br>
            The Society tries to sue you. You buy their clubhouse and turn it into a VR ghost maze.<br>
            Bhoot Raja? He sticks around.<br>
            “You think I’d leave before my biopic drops?”<br>
            He’s even in the promotional posters.<br>
            He adds you as his emergency contact.<br>
            Rinki makes crores.<br>
            You become famous.<br>
            The house… is never quiet again.<br>
            And you’re okay with that.<br>
        </p>

    <div id="part-mischiefendings">
        <p>
            You look at the scroll. Then the mango tree. Then Bhoot Raja.<br>
            “Here’s the plan,” you say. “We bribe the Society.”<br>
            Rinki gasps.<br>
            “With ghost secrets?”<br>
            “No. With gulab jamuns and free WiFi.”<br>
            She blinks. Then nods.<br>
            Three months later…<br>
            Bhoot Bungalow reopens as a ghost-themed co-working café. Each room is named after a haunting:<br>
            The Whispering Washroom (private office)<br>
            Mango Tree Memories (podcast studio)<br>
            Ghungroo Confession Zone (Zoom booths)<br>
            Guests get:<br>
            Discounted ghost naps<br>
            Mango-scented tea<br>
            A loyalty program called “Bhoot Points”<br>
            The Society?<br>
            Totally bribed. They get lifetime tea refills and custom slippers.<br>
            GuruMoo?<br>
            Now runs the Instagram page.<br>
            Bhoot Raja stays. He gives TED Talks.<br>
            Mostly about poetry. Sometimes about taxes.<br>
            You?<br>
            You finally sleep in the bungalow and don’t get haunted.<br>
            (Okay. Maybe once. But it was just the laddu trying to spoon you.)<br>
