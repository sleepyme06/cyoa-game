        <h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
        <p>
            You and Rinki are crouched beneath the prayer room, brushing dirt off something metallic. The brass key you found earlier fits perfectly into a lock embedded in the floor.<br>
            With a heavy click, a hidden panel opens.<br>
            Inside: stairs. Winding. Dusty. Definitely not up to code.<br>
            Rinki lights her phone flashlight.<br>
            “You first. I’m only here for the views.”<br>
            “You mean moral support?”<br>
            “No. Literally the YouTube views.”<br>
            You descend into a narrow underground corridor, lit by thin shafts of light from rusted air vents. Faded family portraits line the walls. Someone has scribbled all over them in red ink. Not blood, probably. Hopefully.<br>
            At the end: a trapdoor with an inscription:<br>
            “Jahan dopehar ki roshni bhi thak jaaye,
            vahan baith ke sach roya tha.”<br>
            You stare.<br>
            “That’s... the bathroom.”<br>
            Rinki nods.<br>
            “Specifically, the guest bathroom. The one no one ever cleaned.”<br>
            Back upstairs, the two of you race to it.<br>
            Behind the old water tank, hidden under a fake tile, you find:<br>
            A cracked mirror with a map etched in the glass<br>
            A mango pit, petrified and marked with a symbol matching the vault drawing<br>
            A brass bangle wrapped in fabric embroidered: “Forgive me. - C”<br>
            Rinki mutters:<br>
            “I’m starting to think Chhotu didn’t steal anything. He was hiding it. Protecting it.”<br>
            “From who?”<br>
            “From everyone.”<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="six.html">Dig further into blueprints and facts</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Compare the bangle with Bhoot Raja’s riddles</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Toss the mango pit into the pooja fire just to see</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
        <p>
            The blueprint led you to the archives, a maze of old trunks and locked almirahs.<br>
            You find Chhotu Babu’s khajana journal, wrapped in a dusty shawl and bound with string. The handwriting inside is frantic.<br>
            Each entry is increasingly paranoid:<br>
            “The Raja suspects.”<br>
            “He’s getting too close to the vault.”<br>
            “I love him, but I must finish this.”<br>
            At the center of the book, a sealed envelope.<br>
            As you open it, the ink ignites with a hiss.<br>
            A disembodied voice — low, apologetic — echoes:<br>
            “I only meant to hide it for a day, Saheb… but fear got to me. Forgive me.”<br>
            The flames vanish.<br>
            The journal is now blank.<br>
            Suddenly, the walls flicker. Paint peels backwards, revealing a mural hidden beneath layers of time:<br>
            A mango tree.<br>
            Two men standing beneath it.<br>
            One weeping. The other holding a scroll and a bangle.<br>
            You back away, heart pounding.<br>
            Behind the cabinet, you find:<br>
            A box labeled “Teakwood Vault – Emergency Access”<br>
            A tiny scroll tied to a ghungroo<br>
            A torn receipt for 12 gulab jamuns and 1 lockbox<br>
            The ghungroo hums softly when touched.<br>
            “The password,” Bhoot Raja whispers beside you, “is ridiculous.”<br>
            “What is it?”<br>
            “...Gulabjamun123.”<br>
            You sigh.<br>
            “Of course it is.”<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="six.html">Use the ghungroo’s music to continue decoding</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Test the password on the nearest box</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Seek out Rinki and cross-reference vault maps</a></li>
            </ul>

    <div id="part-c" class="story-part">
        <h1>CHAPTER 5</h1>
        <p>
            You and Bhoot Raja are mid-argument over whether the mango pit should be thrown into a fan or not when the laddu in your pocket starts vibrating violently.<br>
            “Follow it!” Bhoot Raja yells.<br>
            You do. It leads you past the haunted music room, past the pickled spirits closet, and into the garden.<br>
            The mango tree waits.<br>
            Thick roots. Deep shade. A stone plaque at the base reads:<br>
            “DO NOT DIG.”<br>
            Naturally, you begin digging immediately.<br>
            Three inches in, your shovel hits something metallic.<br>
            You clear it off — a lockbox embedded in stone, marked with ornate carvings and one extremely dumb password pad.<br>
            You punch in: GULABJAMUN123<br>
            Click.<br>
            The box opens.<br>
            Inside:<br>
            A miniature will, handwritten and official<br>
            A teakwood key shaped like a mango<br>
            A final letter addressed to “The One Who Wasn’t Supposed to Be Here”<br>
            You read it aloud. The handwriting is panicked:<br>
            “I failed him. I tried to protect the family. But they would’ve destroyed it. The vault has the recipe... and more. It has the real reason we never left this house.”<br>
            Bhoot Raja, unusually quiet, murmurs:<br>
            “He loved me enough to lie.”<br>
            “To everyone?”<br>
            “Even to himself.”<br>
            You close the box gently.<br>
            The ground beneath your feet rumbles.<br>
            The mango tree shudders.<br>
            A root shifts — revealing stairs.<br>
            Leading down.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="six.html">Grab Bhoot Raja and dive in</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Consult the will with poetic clues</a></li>
                <li><a href="six.html">Message Rinki and say “WE FOUND A VAULT IN THE YARD” </a></li>
            </ul>
