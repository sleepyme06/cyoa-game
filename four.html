        <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
        <p>
            You’re in the courtyard, trying to unlock a rusted lockbox using brute force and a mild tantrum.<br>
            Rinki arrives, riding pillion on a scooty driven by an auto-wala she claims is “ghost-resistant.”<br>
            She hops off with a camera, a modified Walkman, and enough chewing gum to build a small fort.<br>
            “Okay, genius,” she says. “You’ve got a haunted house and some kind of Bollywood ghost. Let’s go full paranormal investigation mode.”<br>
            You roll your eyes but let her in.<br>
            Within minutes:<br>
            She reprograms her EMF Walkman into a spectral scanner.<br>
            It leads you to a cracked stone tile near the prayer room.<br>
            You lift it to reveal a sealed passage and a note etched into the stone.<br>
            "Teakwood Vault – Access only through bloodline, betrayal, and bhindi."<br>
            You both stare at each other.<br>
            “Did he say bhindi?”<br>
            “We’ll pretend it means something.”<br>
            Then Rinki finds something big: behind the tulsi pot, the EMF screams. She unearths:<br>
            A burnt legal deed, referencing “Raj Mahal Wing – Teakwood Vault – NOT FOR CHHOTU”<br>
            A faded photo of two men standing under a mango tree—one looks like Bhoot Raja, the other is labeled: “Chhotu (he blinked)”<br>
            A page from a journal signed... Chhotu Babu, dated 1947<br>
            It reads:<br>
            “He trusted me. And I locked it away. I couldn’t tell him. The war was coming. I thought I’d have time.”<br>
            Suddenly, the tulsi pot topples on its own, revealing a small brass key.<br>
            The key glows briefly, then cools.<br>
            “Okay,” Rinki mutters. “Either this is a Disney Channel Original Movie... or we’re in way deeper than we thought.”<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-a">Use the key on the nearby wall panel and keep it rational</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-b">Take the journal page and seek ghost context</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-c">Give Rinki the laddu and see what explodes </a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
        <p>
            The scroll leads you to the old library, where the walls smell of decaying pages and secret resentment.<br>
            Bhoot Raja appears with flair, floating sideways for no reason.<br>
            “Ah! The library. Where words once wept.”<br>
            You push past a shelf. Behind it: a hidden room lined with strange objects.<br>
            Each one glows faintly.<br>
            You find:<br>
            A brass bell with the engraving:<br>
            “Strike only where silence rules.”<br>
            A mango pickle jar that hums when touched<br>
            A cracked floor tile under which lies a letter, wrapped in a silk handkerchief<br>
            The letter is from Raja’s wife.<br>
            “You always loved riddles more than me. I’ve hidden your inheritance beneath the mango roots. But first, unlock your shame.”<br>
            The pickle jar jiggles violently. You unscrew the lid.<br>
            It screams again:<br>
            “HE LIED! CHHOTU KNEW!”<br>
            Raja winces.<br>
            “Ignore the mango. She’s dramatic.”<br>
            But you can’t ignore the blueprint drawn in turmeric on the back of the letter.<br>
            It shows:<br>
            A buried vault under the east wing<br>
            Symbols matching the bell, the ghungroo, and the number 1947<br>
            A warning: “Do not speak the name Chhotu Babu within its walls”<br>
            You whisper the name anyway.<br>
            The bell rings by itself. The walls shake. A book bursts into flames.<br>
            “YOU HAD ONE JOB,” Bhoot Raja screams as he panics into smoke form.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-b">Rebuild the burnt blueprint using science</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-a">Run downstairs to find someone who’s good with puzzles</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-c">Yell “GULABJAMUN123” into the bell to see what happens</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>CHAPTER 4</h1>
        <p>
            You return to the east wing, guided by the laddu's now erratic buzzing.<br>
            Badshah Bhoot waits.<br>
            He’s wearing a silk cape, sunglasses, and somehow has a fan blowing wind at him.<br>
            “Welcome back, mortal. Ready to host the drama of the century?”<br>
            “What... are we doing exactly?”<br>
            “Riddle Duel. Winner gets access to the memory well.”<br>
            Before you can object, a circle of floating pickles surrounds you. It’s a stage.<br>
            A harmonium plays itself. Bhoot Raja floats in dramatically.<br>
            “Let’s get this over with.”<br>
            The duel begins. You are the judge. You have no rules to follow.<br>
            The riddles escalate:<br>
            Badshah:<br>
            “What walks on four legs at dawn, two at noon, three after Rasgulla?”<br>
            (You respond: “A man with diabetes.”)<br>
            Raja:<br>
            “What lives in silence but whispers in steam?”<br>
            (You respond: “Upma.” He sobs.)<br>
            Suddenly, the trophy — the one they’ve fought over for 80 years — levitates from the wall and implodes into gold dust.<br>
            The pickles collapse.<br>
            A voice echoes:<br>
            “Enough theatrics. The vault awaits.”<br>
            The laddu glows red. It spins. Then flings itself through the air and lands in a hidden compartment behind the stage.<br>
            Inside, you find:<br>
            A box labeled: “Gulabjamun123”<br>
            A key wrapped in silk<br>
            A ghostly wedding invitation:<br>
            Raja Ram Prasad & Mystery Guest<br>
            You raise an eyebrow.<br>
            Raja winces.<br>
            “We don’t talk about that evening.”<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-c">Open the box and see what flies out</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-b">Take the invitation to decode its implications</a></li>
                <li><a href="five.html#part-a">Bring the key to Rinki to make a plan</a></li>
