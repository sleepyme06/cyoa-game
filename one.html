            <p>
            Summer was supposed to be epic.<br>
            Science camp. Zip lines. Frog dissections. Campfire chemistry tricks. And most importantly—a glorious, screen-free experience that your parents promised would help you “reconnect with reality.”<br>
            Instead, reality punched you in the face.<br>
            Somewhere between registration errors, a flash flood, or divine sabotage, camp was cancelled. No refunds. No apologies. Just a sudden suitcase shoved into your arms and your mom cheerfully announcing:<br>
            <em>“You’ll be staying at Mamaji’s house this summer! In the village. He’s abroad. Fresh air will be good for you.”</em><br>
            Good for you, apparently, meant exile.<br>
            Now you’re standing in front of said house—a sprawling, crumbling creature of stone and regret, soaked in monsoon gloom. A narrow path of cracked tiles leads through a garden that looks like it’s plotting something.<br>
            Your sneakers are soaked. Mosquitoes orbit your head like vultures. You're holding your suitcase in one hand and a badminton racket in the other because, well, ghosts probably respect sports equipment.<br>
            The rusted iron gate creaks open. You didn’t touch it.<br>
            Of course you didn’t.<br>
            You step forward.<br>
            A crow caws at you. Directly at you. Judgmentally.<br>
            “Yeah, I hate it too,” you mutter.<br>
            The house looms.<br>
            It’s tall, sagging, and entirely too enthusiastic about being spooky. Moss clings to its corners like guilt. Shutters rattle with dramatic flair. You half-expect thunder to strike just to complete the aesthetic.<br>
            A chill skates down your spine as you approach the front door. Not fear. Not yet. Just... that feeling you get when you realize your summer vacation is going to suck.<br>
            <a href="#" onclick="showNext('part-one', 'part-two')">NEXT</a>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="part-two" class="story-part">
        <p>
            The front porch is made of old teakwood and fresh despair. Your suitcase thuds against the steps as you climb them. A broken nameplate swings above you:<br>
            “SHANTI NIVAS”<br>
            Yeah, right.<br>
            You raise your hand to knock, but the door creaks open before you can touch it.<br>
            There’s no one there.<br>
            There’s nothing there, except stale air that smells like turmeric, rain, and unresolved trauma.<br>
            You step inside.<br>
            The door slams shut behind you.<br>
            “Classic,” you mutter. “Haunted house behavior within five minutes. Great start.”<br>
            Inside, it’s... worse.<br>
            The air is heavy, like the walls are holding their breath. Faded family portraits glare from the walls. A cracked chandelier sways slightly, though there’s no breeze. Somewhere in the distance, a harmonium plays a note that sounds like a sigh.<br>
            You pass a large mirror. Your reflection blinks half a second too slow.<br>
            Okay, that’s new.<br>
            You shake it off and move toward the staircase. Everything groans under your weight—floorboards, railings, your will to live.<br>
            At the landing above, three hallways branch out in opposite directions.<br>
            And then you hear it.<br>
            From the left: a whispering voice behind a locked door.<br>
            From the right: a rickety trapdoor to the attic swings open, inviting.<br>
            Straight ahead: something crashes. Then giggles. Multiple. None of them belong to you.<br>
            <a href="#" onclick="showNext('part-two','part-three')">NEXT</a>

    <div id="part-three" class="story-part">
        <p>
            You take a deep breath.<br>
            You're not a believer. Not exactly. But this house is definitely... active.<br>
            Your phone, previously fully charged, now displays 13% battery. The WiFi network is named BHOOT_4G but requires a password you’ll never guess.<br>
            You notice three objects at your feet. You definitely didn’t see them before:<br>
            A dusty old notebook, its pages scribbled in multiple languages, diagrams, and codes.<br>
            A copper bell, warm to the touch despite the rain.<br>
            A half-empty Frooti, chilled, with a straw already in it.<br>
            You slowly look around.<br>
            There’s no one else here.<br>
            Your fingers twitch. Your brain itches. Your summer just got very weird, very fast.<br>

        <h2>Choose Your Path — and Your Doom</h2>
        <p>Your journey begins now.<br>
            But remember—paths may cross. What you ignore now may haunt you later.<br>
            Choose wisely.<br>
