          The trapdoor groans open beneath the mango tree, revealing stairs that
          shouldn’t exist.<br />
          You descend with Rinki behind you, her EMF reader twitching like it’s
          having a tiny panic attack. Bhoot Raja floats beside you, unusually
          quiet.<br />
          The tunnel is narrow, lined with slick stone and carvings you don’t
          understand. The air is thick with turmeric and dust. Your breath fogs
          in front of you. Time feels slow.<br />
          At the end, a circular door made of teakwood.<br />
          Rinki runs her fingers across it.<br />
          “There’s no handle.”<br />
          “There’s no lock,” you whisper.<br />
          The laddu in your pocket vibrates once, then crumbles.<br />
          The door swings open.<br />
          Inside: a circular chamber, its walls covered in paintings and poems,
          all written in flickering ghost-light.<br />
          In the center: a raised stone platform holding a single brass bowl and
          a folded sherwani.<br />
          You step forward.<br />
          The moment your foot touches the platform—<br />
          the walls ripple—<br />
          your body lurches—<br />
          and suddenly—<br />
          you are no longer you.<br />
          <a href="#" onclick="showNext('part-one', 'part-two')">NEXT</a>
        </p>
      </div>

  <div id="part-two" class="story-part">
        <p>
          You blink.<br />
          The walls are gone.<br />
          Your hands are older. Heavier. Ringed with calluses and gold.<br />
          You are standing in a large drawing room—ornate, candlelit. Through
          the open window, the mango tree sways in the afternoon breeze. A brass
          bowl of steaming upma sits on the table beside you.<br />
          Voices echo from the hallway.<br />
          You know what’s coming.<br />
          Or at least, he does.<br />
          Footsteps. Fast. Angry.<br />
          The door bursts open.<br />
          Chhotu Babu storms in—thin, sweating, ink-stained fingers clenched
          around a folded paper.<br />
          “You locked it, didn’t you? You actually locked it.”<br />
          Your voice, though not yours, speaks smoothly:<br />
          “Of course I did. Do you know what they’d do with it if they found it?
          The recipe, the coins, the land deed—it’s all connected. This family
          isn’t ready.”<br />
          “It’s not your decision!”<br />
          “It is now.”<br />
          Chhotu throws the paper at you. It flutters to the floor.<br />
          “They’ll think I stole it, Raja. You’re handing me the blame.”<br />
          “Let them,” you say. “You’re stronger than I am. You’ll survive a
          little scandal. I wouldn’t.”<br />
          Silence.<br />
          You turn back toward the window. Your own words echo like a curse:<br />
          “They only listen to me when I rhyme, Chhotu. Not when I beg.”<br />
          Chhotu steps forward—nearer than before. He softens.<br />
          “You’re afraid. That’s all this is.”<br />
          You turn.<br />
          And then—<br />
          The smell.<br />
          The upma.<br />
          The bitter taste in your mouth.<br />
          You stagger.<br />
          You see the bowl fall.<br />
          You see Chhotu’s face twist—not with guilt, but with shock.<br />
          “RAJA—NO—I—”<br />
          Darkness.<br />
          The last thing you feel is a ghungroo around your wrist loosening.<br />
          <a href="#" onclick="showNext('part-two', 'part-three')">NEXT</a>
        </p>
      </div>

  <div id="part-three" class="story-part">
        <p>
          You gasp—and when you inhale, you are breathing through Chhotu Babu’s
          lungs.<br />
          Your back aches. Your hands tremble.<br />
          You’re in a dusty hallway. It’s raining outside. You’re soaking wet,
          carrying a brass key and a letter you’ll never send.<br />
          In the guest bathroom, you kneel and pull up the floor tiles. Beneath
          them: a trapdoor. A vault key. The bangle you couldn’t return.<br />
          “I only meant to hide it for one day,” you whisper.<br />
          From the courtyard, voices approach.<br />
          People are coming. The servants. The lawyers. The brother-in-law with
          the oily mustache.<br />
          You close the vault.<br />
          You whisper to the mango tree:<br />
          “Forgive him. Blame me.”<br />
          Then you vanish into the night.<br />
          The memory fractures—<br />
          the walls shatter—<br />
          and you are falling—<br />
          <a href="#" onclick="showNext('part-three', 'part-four')">NEXT</a>
        </p>
      </div>
  <div id="part-four" class="story-part">
        <p>
          You gasp.<br />
          Back in your own body.<br />
          The memory chamber is still. Faint echoes of poetry linger in the air.
          Rinki kneels beside you, watching carefully.<br />
          Across the chamber, Bhoot Raja hovers—silent. For once.<br />
          “You saw it,” he says.<br />
          You nod.<br />
          He places a hand over his heart.<br />
          “I was not murdered. Not by Chhotu. Not really.”<br />
          “You poisoned yourself?” Rinki asks, shocked.<br />
          “I... underestimated the spice level of my own upma. But that’s beside
          the point.”<br />
          He floats closer. There are tears in his eyes—spectral, gold, and
          glowing.<br />
          “He tried to save me. In his way. He gave up everything to keep my
          legacy safe.”<br />
          You reach for the teakwood box.<br />
          It opens.<br />
          Inside:<br />
          A leather-bound will<br />
          A velvet pouch of ancestral gold coins<br />
          A scroll titled:<br />
          “RAJA RAM PRASAD’S ROYAL PULAO – with adjusted salt ratios”<br />
          At the bottom of the box, one final note:<br />
          “Let it go, Raja. Rest. Share what we built. The treasure isn’t the
          gold. It’s the damn mango tree.” — C.B.<br />
          You close the box.<br />
          The light in the vault begins to flicker, then brighten.<br />
          Bhoot Raja looks at you.<br />
          “It’s your decision now. My story’s been told. But what happens to
          this house... that’s up to you.”<br />
          Rinki, arms crossed, smirks.<br />
          “Well? You gonna make him a viral legend? Start a co-working space? Or
          just donate it all and walk away?”<br />
