        <h1>CHAPTER 6</h1>
        <h3>Setting: Bhoot Bungalow, mid-monsoon.</h3>
        <p>
            The vault is nearly uncovered. You hold secrets, clues, and maybe a ghost contract.
            And then—your phone pings.<br>
            It begins with a text from Rinki:<br>
            RINKI:<br>
            “Uhhh. We’ve got visitors. Like, A LOT. Also... a cow just tried to headbutt me. Send help?”<br>
            You peek through the cracked window.<br>
            The Society President has arrived.<br>
            And he’s brought reinforcements:<br>
            A Bluetooth-enabled sadhu, broadcasting mantras at max volume from his phone.<br>
            Three aunties with steel tiffins, full of judgment and very spicy murmura.<br>
            And, most ominously, a divine cow named GuruMoo, draped in marigold chains and righteous fury.<br>
            Rinki rushes inside, slamming the door.<br>
            “They think we’ve disturbed a ghost-temple-zone. Apparently Mamaji’s house is now under ‘cultural siege’.”<br>
            Bhoot Raja appears mid-air, twirling dramatically.<br>
            “They cannot silence me. I am poetry incarnate!”<br>
            You try to explain the situation to the Society President—who refuses to cross the threshold.<br>
            “We are invoking Residential Code Section 13-Bhoo. No ghost play, no underground digging, and absolutely no drama-based haunting after 5pm.”<br>
            The Bluetooth sadhu nods solemnly and begins chanting “Ghost Mukt Bharat” from a SoundCloud playlist.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="#part-a">Perform a fake exorcism to trick the Society into leaving</a></li>
                <li><a href="#part-b">Sneak into the Society President’s car and steal his blueprints</a></li>
                <li><a href="#part-c">Use Bhoot Raja’s scroll to decode the ancient ghost contract</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="part-a">
        <p>
            You and Rinki rig the EMF reader to a smoke machine.<br>
            Bhoot Raja performs a dramatic exit monologue.<br>
            GuruMoo gets offered a banana. Everyone leaves peacefully.<br>

    <div id="part-b">
        <p>
            Rinki distracts the sadhu by asking about astrology.<br>
            You crawl under tiffin shadows and snatch a folder labeled “Structural Maps – Mamaji’s Vault”.<br>
            Inside: a second entrance to the vault. Beneath the guest bathroom.<br>
            <a href="seven.html">NEXT</a>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="part-c">
        <p>
            The contract outlines:<br>
            “To free the spirit, the legacy must be witnessed by bloodline, stranger, and betrayer.”<br>
            You, Rinki, and possibly Chhotu Babu’s ghost (???), must enter the vault together.<br>
            GuruMoo moos approvingly.<br>
