        <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
        <p>
            You’ve decided to keep things normal. Or at least, normal-adjacent. Ignoring the glowing ghosts, magic laddu, and poetry battles seems like the healthiest choice.<br>
            You return to the servant’s quarters.<br>
            There, you find a hidden compartment behind a crooked portrait. Inside:<br>
            A moldy diary, written in Tamil and Hindi, soaked with old oil stains.<br>
            A sketch of a mango tree with an underground passage marked.<br>
            And stuck to the last page: a scrap of newspaper from 1946. Headline reads:<br>
            "LOCAL ACCOUNTANT ACCUSED OF THEFT — CHHOTU BABU MISSING."<br>
            The floor creaks behind you.<br>
            You spin.<br>
            It’s Rinki, filming with her phone and chewing gum like she’s trying to intimidate the wallpaper.<br>
            “Is that... a ghost clue? You found one without me?!”<br>
            “I’m not even sure if—”<br>
            “Shush. We’re going viral.”<br>
            She rewires her EMF Walkman, which immediately starts making static shrieks in front of the old tulsi pot in the courtyard.<br>
            You dig beneath it and discover:<br>
            A lockbox (padlocked, rusted)<br>
            A burnt legal document partially signed “...Teakwood Vault, Raja Ram Pras...”<br>
            A crumpled napkin with “Chhotu Babu &lt;3 Kulfi” written on it<br>
            Rinki squints.<br>
            “Wait. Teakwood Vault. That’s real. It’s in Mamaji’s plans. I saw it once.”<br>
            “You read building plans?”<br>
            “I read everything. I’m emotionally attached to blueprints.”<br>
            Then, your phone buzzes with a voice note. It's static... and a poem:<br>
            “Jahan dopehar ki roshni bhi thak jaaye,<br>
            vahan baith ke sach roya tha.”<br>
            Rinki goes pale.<br>
            “That’s the bathroom.”<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-a">Refuse to believe a haunted bathroom matters</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-b">Recognize the poetic voice as Bhoot Raja’s</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-c">Let Rinki record you dramatically yelling in the toilet</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
        <p>
            You’re elbows-deep in ancient scrolls, translating metaphors about mangoes and betrayal.<br>
            Bhoot Raja reappears in bursts of ghazal and ghee. He floats by a wall panel and mutters:<br>
            “Chhotu always hid things beneath sweet things... and under brass.”<br>
            You investigate.<br>
            Behind a shelf of brass utensils, you find:<br>
            A brass bell with an engraving underneath:<br>
            “Strike me at dawn, for truth to ring.”<br>
            A pickled mango jar labeled: “Property of Raja Ram Prasad – Do Not Consume (Seriously).”<br>
            It vibrates when you ask, “Where’s the vault?”<br>
            You cautiously unscrew the lid.<br>
            The mango hums.<br>
            Then it screams:<br>
            “Ghooooooossttt vaaauuulllttt! Chaubey locked it!”<br>
            You fall over. The mango continues humming, smugly.<br>
            Elsewhere, under a cracked floorboard, you find a letter in invisible ink:<br>
            “Chhotu, I did not betray you. I only meant to protect you. Saheb never trusted me.”<br>
            Raja floats beside you, tearfully.<br>
            “They were in love. That complicates things.”<br>
            “What?!”<br>
            “Yes. Forbidden. Tragic. Mango-filled. Our servant drama was far ahead of its time.”<br>
            You sit down, overwhelmed.<br>
            The final clue lies tied in the ghungroo of a shattered Kathak statue in the music room. The ankle bells hum faintly. When you touch them, you see a vision of:<br>
            The vault<br>
            The mango tree<br>
            A man crying while holding a laddu<br>
            You blink. The room returns to normal.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-b">Keep solving the poetry-based riddles</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-a">Start fact-checking with Rinki</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-c">Ask the screaming mango more questions</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

    <div id="part-c" class="story-part">
        <h1>CHAPTER 3</h1>
        <p>
            You awaken from a nap on the memory trunk, surrounded by sparkles and the sound of distant tabla solos.<br>
            Bhoot Raja floats beside you, wearing sunglasses he did not have earlier.<br>
            “You’ve done it. We’re now memory-linked. Also I borrowed your socks while you slept.”<br>
            He tosses you your socks. They’re mildly ectoplasmic.<br>
            You now have access to:<br>
            The ghost cloak, upgraded (now slightly more invisible)<br>
            The vibrating laddu, glowing faintly red<br>
            The memory projector, which only activates during naps or severe boredom<br>
            Together, you sneak through the house like dramatic fools.<br>
            Then you accidentally awaken…<br>
            Badshah Bhoot.<br>
            A rival ghost. Stuck in the east wing. Wearing 40 pounds of drama.<br>
            “RAAAJAAAA! YOU STILL OWE ME A TROPHY!”<br>
            “It was rigged, you jalebi-brained thespian!”<br>
            “I DEMAND A RE-MATCH!”<br>
            Suddenly, your entire world becomes:<br>
            A pun-based riddle duel between ghosts<br>
            Floating pickle jars attacking from all angles<br>
            You dodging a floating harmonium with a scream-laugh soundtrack<br>
            Eventually, Badshah’s cursed poetry trophy is found buried in the planter. It glows. You touch it.<br>
            A memory flares:<br>
            The vault door<br>
            The number: Gulabjamun123<br>
            A mango tree. Again. Always the mango tree.<br>
            Bhoot Raja whispers:<br>
            “We’re getting close.”<br>
            You high-five the ghost.<br>
            It passes through your hand and knocks over a vase.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-c">Nap again for another vision</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-b">Ask what "Gulabjamun123" really unlocks</a></li>
                <li><a href="four.html#part-a">Go find Rinki and tell her everything</a></li>
            </ul>
