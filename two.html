        <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
        <p>
            You slam the attic door shut before the harmonium’s next creepy note can finish.<br>
            “Nope,” you mutter, stepping back. “We’re not doing attic ghosts today. We’re doing… logic. Furniture. Predictable floorboards.”<br>
            Downstairs, you hug the walls, sticking to well-lit areas. The flickering chandelier in the hallway is annoying but not terrifying. Probably loose wiring. Or moths. Or haunted moths. Either way, not your problem.<br>
            You find yourself in Mamaji’s study. It smells like old leather, chai residue, and forgotten tax documents. The desk is cluttered, but there's a certain boring safety to it.<br>
            Until you look up and see your reflection in the glass cabinet.<br>
            Behind you.<br>
            A glowing sherwani floats mid-air, slowly rotating.<br>
            You whirl around.<br>
            Nothing.<br>
            You whirl back.<br>
            Still there.<br>
            You take a strategic step backward.<br>
            The pooja lamp in the corner flickers to life with a sudden pop. It pulses three times.<br>
            You stare.<br>
            It pulses again—dot, dot, dash.<br>
            ...Morse code?<br>
            You don't even know Morse code, but the lamp keeps blinking. Underneath it, the floor creaks. Something’s under the floorboard.<br>
            You lift it.<br>
            A crumpled photo falls out: a mango tree with a tiny X drawn underneath. On the back, a sentence:<br>
            “Where memories rot, treasure knots.”<br>
            Your phone buzzes with a message from Rinki:<br>
            "YOU SENT ME A VIDEO OF A FLOATING SHERWANI. WTF. I’M COMING OVER."<br>
            You didn’t send her anything.<br>
            You hear a bang upstairs. Then... a voice reciting poetry. Slowly. Dramatically.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-a">Ignore it</a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-b">Want to investigate that voice</a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-c">Feel oddly compelled to offer the sherwani some Frooti</a></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
        <p>
            You climb into the attic, curiosity fully in charge.<br>
            A harmonium plays itself in the corner. The tune is off-key and ancient, like it’s been looping for a hundred years and has opinions about your fashion sense.<br>
            In the middle of the room: a glowing sherwani floating midair.<br>
            It hovers, rotates, then settles three inches above the dusty carpet.<br>
            A voice booms:<br>
            “WHO TRESPASSES UPON MY SCENTED SCROLLS?”<br>
            You raise a hand, sheepishly.<br>
            “Me? Just… exploring.”<br>
            “SILENCE, MORTAL! SIT. LISTEN.”<br>
            You sit.<br>
            He begins. And dear god, he goes.<br>
            Bhoot Raja, he calls himself. Former poet laureate, chef of legend, tragic hero of a betrayal so dramatic it could be its own daily soap. He spins a tale involving:<br>
            A treasure buried for safekeeping<br>
            A secret pulao recipe with saffron “so powerful, it caused hallucinations”<br>
            A servant named Chhotu Babu, who stole both the recipe and his trust<br>
            A tragic death involving upma and emotional damage<br>
            You nod through the whole thing, trying to look interested while scanning the shelves.<br>
            After 45 minutes of rhymed exposition, he flings a scroll at your head and bellows:<br>
            “DECRYPT THIS AND FIND THE TRUTH!”<br>
            The scroll contains:<br>
            A safe code: 1947<br>
            A turmeric-stained map of the house<br>
            A poem that reads:<br>
            “Where music ceased and memories wept,<br>
            beneath the floor, a bangle slept.”<br>
            Then he vanishes into a cloud of sandalwood-scented dust.<br>
            You cough, a little high on nostalgia and spice.<br>
            The attic seems darker now.<br>
            You unroll the map. It leads to the servant’s quarters.<br>
            Before you can follow, a voice from the trunk whispers:<br>
            “Nap here... and see what I saw.”<br>
            You step back.<br>
            The trunk is glowing faintly.<br> 
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-b">Want to decode the scroll logically </a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-c">Want to nap inside the ghost trunk</a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-a">Want to follow the map to verify physical clues</a></li>
            </ul>

        <h1>CHAPTER 2</h1>
        <p>
            You kick open the attic door, slurp your Frooti loudly, and declare:<br>
            “YO GHOST BRO, YOU WANT A SIP?”<br>
            There is silence.<br>
            Then—the harmonium stops mid-note.<br>
            From the shadows floats a regal, glowing sherwani. Mustache curled like a villain in an 80s drama.<br>
            “What is this offering?” he whispers.<br>
            You raise the Frooti.<br>
            “Mango nectar. Limited edition.”<br>
            The ghost gasps.<br>
            “YOU UNDERSTAND ME.”<br>
            He accepts. Somehow. You don’t question how he drinks it.<br>
            You’ve just formed a psychic contract with Bhoot Raja.<br>
            He gifts you:<br>
            A vibrating laddu that reacts near clues<br>
            A ghost cloak that sort of works, if you don’t breathe too loud<br>
            Access to his nap-based memory projector<br>
            Then he warns:<br>
            “But beware... Badshah Bhoot returns soon.”<br>
            “Who's that?”<br>
            “My drama club rival. We fought over Best Actor. He cursed my trophy. Now he seeks revenge. AND he writes terrible poetry.”<br>
            There is a sudden boom from below.<br>
            A second ghost appears—larger, louder, draped in silk and rage.<br>
            “Rajaaaaaa! YOU STOLE MY MONOLOGUE!”<br>
            They begin dueling.<br>
            With rhymes.<br>
            You duck as a pickle jar explodes beside you.<br>
            Bhoot Raja throws you the laddu.<br>
            “Use it! Or nap! Or distract him with dramatic flair!”<br>
            You dodge a flying sherwani sleeve and hide behind a table.<br>
            You:<br>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-a">eat the laddu near the wall</a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-c">Use ghost cloak and nap</a></li>
                <li><a href="three.html#part-b">Pull out the scroll tucked in your back pocket</a></li>
            </ul>
